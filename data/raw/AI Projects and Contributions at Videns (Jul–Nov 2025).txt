AI Projects and Contributions at Videns (Jul–Nov 
2025)
AI Strategy and Use Case Roadmap for LGI Healthcare Solutions 
(Novacap Portfolio)
Upon joining Videns in late July 2025, I took on a lead role in an AI transformation 
project for LGI Healthcare Solutions, a healthcare software provider recently 
acquired by Novacap. In this engagement, I helped analyze and prioritize AI use 
cases and formulate a multi-phase AI adoption roadmap for the client’s products 
and internal operations. Working closely with Videns colleagues and LGI 
stakeholders, I bridged business needs with technical possibilities to drive a 
comprehensive AI strategy.
*	Use Case Discovery & Feasibility: I collaborated in identifying dozens of 
potential AI use cases across LGI’s hospital management systems (product 
use cases) and internal processes. For each idea, I assessed its business 
value, data requirements, and technical feasibility. We documented these in 
Excel and presented a synthesis to the client[1]. For example, I helped 
compile an Excel inventory of AI opportunities along with a PowerPoint 
summary of findings for both the product and internal “streams”[2][3]. I 
contributed my AI expertise to estimate implementation effort (“t-shirt 
sizing”) and to score each use case’s potential impact. This allowed us to 
prioritize high-value, moderate-effort use cases (as later confirmed by 
client leadership’s prioritization[4]). I also outlined next steps for deeper 
analysis, such as evaluating technical risks and ROI in follow-up 
workshops[5].
*	Technical Evaluation & Architecture: For top-priority use cases, I provided 
a deeper technical assessment. In one instance, I added a new “POC 
Architecture” column to the use case analysis to sketch how a proof-of-
concept solution might be architected[6]. This involved describing at a high 
level which AI components, data sources, and integrations would be needed 
(even though specific solutions weren’t chosen yet[6]). For example, one 
high-priority case was optimizing patient flow in hospitals. I identified 
opportunities to apply real-time data orchestration and predictive analytics: 
automating alerts/notifications, adding a predictive “overlay” layer to 
coordinate bed management and patient transfers, and AI-driven decision 
support for inter-hospital transfers[7]. Another use case focused on 
enhancing LGI’s RPA (Robotic Process Automation) system with AI. I 
proposed integrating NLP and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable the 
RPA to read and understand unstructured documents (PDFs, faxes, forms) 
and even generate summaries or text as needed[8]. These technical insights 
– e.g. suggesting predictive orchestration for patient logistics and using LLMs 
to boost automation – were directly incorporated into the client discussions 
and planning. I also helped formulate critical questions about system 
integration, data governance, and security (for instance, how to handle 
sensitive data and two-factor authentication in AI-driven workflows) to guide 
the client’s requirements[9].
*	Roadmap & Phased Implementation: Leveraging the above analysis, I co-
developed a phased AI roadmap for LGI. The roadmap was structured into 
multiple “volets” (phases) aligning with the client’s strategic priorities. 
Volet 1 centered on quick wins and foundational steps, Volet 2 on deeper 
solution development, and Volet 3 on scaling and long-term capabilities. 
Notably, we defined an initial feasibility phase (Volet 1) to validate use 
cases and build stakeholder buy-in, followed by a strategy/architecture 
phase (Volet 2) to incorporate client’s strategic documents and refine the 
implementation plan[10][11]. The final phase was envisioned to include 
prototyping select use cases and establishing AI governance. This roadmap 
approach ensured the client had a clear timeline and path to gradually 
integrate AI into their products and operations.
Throughout this project, I acted as a technical subject-matter expert, working in 
tandem with a data strategy specialist and a BI specialist. I interfaced regularly with 
the client’s team (product owners, IT managers, and Novacap representatives) to 
validate assumptions and refine requirements. By early October, our deliverables – 
including the prioritized use case lists, effort/value analysis, and a phased 
implementation plan – had equipped LGI’s leadership with a concrete strategy to 
begin their AI journey.
AI Upskilling and Maturity Evaluation for Client Teams
As part of the AI roadmap for LGI, I also spearheaded education and maturity 
assessment initiatives to ensure the client’s teams were prepared for the 
upcoming AI-driven changes. This included designing a custom AI training program 
and utilizing Videns’ proprietary AI maturity platform, Lucia, to benchmark progress.
*	AI Training Program (Generative AI & Fundamentals): I co-developed and 
delivered a “Formation Générale” (general AI training) module as Volet 1 
of the roadmap[12]. This training was targeted at a broad audience – from 
executives to operational staff – to build a solid understanding of AI concepts 
and use cases. I worked with colleagues to create a slide deck covering AI 
basics, machine learning concepts, and specific focus on generative AI (e.g. 
ChatGPT use cases) in the client’s context. We included practical examples 
(like how AI could optimize hospital workflows or automate document 
processing) and interactive elements. I also prepared a concise cheat-sheet 
reference for participants to reinforce key concepts and safe AI practices. 
The first iteration of the French presentation was sent to the client in mid-
October[12], and I incorporated client feedback (via comments on slides) to 
ensure the content addressed their questions. Once the French version was 
validated, I coordinated the creation of an English version[13], 
demonstrating flexibility in bilingual delivery. This upskilling initiative 
equipped client decision-makers and technical teams with the knowledge to 
engage in AI projects meaningfully. It also included training on applied 
generative AI, where I demonstrated how tools like ChatGPT could be used 
responsibly for tasks such as summarizing reports or analyzing free-text 
data, tailored to the client’s use cases.
*	AI Maturity Assessment (Lucia Platform): To baseline the client’s AI 
readiness, I facilitated an AI maturity assessment using Videns’ Lucia 
platform. Lucia is an online tool (developed by Videns, now Cofomo) that 
evaluates an organization’s adoption level of AI across dimensions like 
strategy, data, skills, and governance. I obtained access to Lucia in 
September[14] and participated in the beta-testing program for the platform 
to familiarize myself with its features. I guided LGI’s key stakeholders 
through the Lucia assessment questionnaire, helping interpret questions 
where needed. After the assessment, I analyzed the generated maturity 
report to identify gaps and strengths in LGI’s AI capabilities. The results 
provided a quantitative measure of their AI maturity and were used to tailor 
our recommendations. For instance, if the assessment showed low maturity 
in data governance, we emphasized that in the roadmap’s later phases. The 
Lucia platform, “powered by Videns”, was an invaluable tool – it lent 
structure to our evaluation and added credibility to our findings[14]. I also 
provided feedback to the Videns product team as a beta user, suggesting 
improvements in the assessment questions relevance to real client 
scenarios. This dual role – assessing the client and enhancing an internal AI 
product – expanded my expertise in AI governance and measurement 
frameworks.
By combining hands-on training with a formal maturity audit, I ensured that our 
client not only received a strategic plan on paper, but also developed the internal 
awareness and readiness to execute it. These efforts were key in building trust with 
the client’s team and empowering them to take ownership of their AI initiatives 
moving forward.
Generative AI Security Research (Prompt Injection Defense)
In parallel with client-facing projects, I devoted time to an internal R&D initiative at 
Videns: LLM security and prompt injection defense. Generative AI was a 
component of our solutions, so ensuring its safe and ethical use was paramount. I 
took the initiative to research and prototype a “prompt injection firewall” – a 
system to protect Large Language Models from malicious or unintended 
instructions.
*	Problem Identification: Prompt injection is a known vulnerability where an 
external input can manipulate an AI model’s behavior. I recognized that as 
we integrate GPT-4 and similar LLMs into enterprise workflows (e.g. for 
document understanding or chatbots), we needed safeguards against such 
attacks. I started by reviewing state-of-the-art research on multi-layer 
defenses for LLMs, including academic papers and security blogs.
*	Prototype Development: I created a dedicated GitHub repository named 
“prompt-injection-security” under the Videns organization to develop and 
test mitigation strategies[15]. Working primarily in Python, I built a pipeline 
that experimented with multiple defense techniques – for example, input 
sanitization, intent verification using secondary AI models, and rule-based 
filtering of model outputs. I implemented automated tests and CI workflows 
to validate the approach. (The CI logs show my active development – e.g., a 
GitHub Actions workflow running tests in early November[16].) One concept 
I prototyped was a multi-agent guardrail: using a secondary AI agent to 
scrutinize or rephrase user prompts before they reach the main LLM, thereby 
neutralizing malicious patterns. I also tested output filtering, where the 
LLM’s response is analyzed for any policy violations before release. This 
work was done using open-source libraries and our internal Azure OpenAI 
sandbox for safe testing.
*	Results and Impact: By the end of this period, I had a working proof-of-
concept “LLM Firewall” that demonstrated a multi-phase defense against 
prompt injection. For example, my prototype could intercept a prompt 
attempting to prompt the model to reveal confidential data and either block 
it or reframe it safely. I documented the findings and best practices and 
shared them with Videns’ innovation group. This R&D project strengthened 
our internal knowledge of AI security. It directly informed guidelines for 
deploying ChatGPT-like solutions for clients – my work ensured we advise on 
proper guardrails and increase client confidence in using generative AI. In 
short, I not only contributed to client deliverables but also to Videns’ 
innovation portfolio by addressing cutting-edge AI safety challenges.
Exploratory AI Initiatives in Other Sectors
Beyond the major healthcare project, I have begun extending my AI expertise to new 
domains and clients for Videns. Notably, in early November I started engaging with 
a client in the hospitality sector – Germain Hotels – to explore AI opportunities. I 
participated in an introductory meeting with Germain’s innovation lead to discuss 
how AI could improve their operations and guest experience[17]. In preparation, I 
researched common AI use cases in hospitality (such as demand forecasting, 
personalized marketing, and chatbots for guest services) so I could bring informed 
ideas to the table. During our kickoff call, I helped identify areas where AI might 
add value – for example, using machine learning to optimize pricing and 
occupancy, or implementing a GPT-powered virtual concierge for guests. While this 
project is still in the discovery phase, I am slated to provide AI advisory and 
potentially pilot solutions for them, broadening Videns’ reach into hospitality 
analytics.
Internally, I also contributed to cross-team knowledge sharing. I regularly 
attended and sometimes led our Scrum meetings and Confluence documentation 
sessions for ongoing projects. For instance, I collaborated with colleagues like 
Sonia Montserrat on maintaining project pages (e.g. the Novacap P123 Confluence 
space) and ensured our plans were transparently documented[18]. I’ve been an 
early adopter of new collaboration tools as Videns integrates with Cofomo – 
whether it’s migrating our email to the Cofomo domain[19] or leveraging the 
corporate ChatGPT Team license (which I proactively requested on my first 
week[20]). By working agilely and collaboratively, I helped the team deliver quality 
results under tight timelines.
Tools, Technologies, and Skills Utilized
Over these first months, I have leveraged a broad set of tools and skills to deliver 
value:
*	Programming & Data Science: Primarily Python for prototyping AI solutions; 
experience with data analysis and machine learning libraries. Set up GitHub 
projects with CI/CD for R&D (as with the prompt injection security repo)[16]. 
Familiar with cloud AI services (Azure OpenAI) and integration via APIs.
*	AI Platforms: Extensive use of ChatGPT (GPT-4) as a productivity tool – from 
brainstorming solution approaches to drafting code snippets. I utilized the 
ChatGPT corporate workspace for safe handling of proprietary info. Also 
used Lucia (Videns’ AI maturity platform) both as a user and tester[14], 
gaining insight into AI governance metrics.
*	Business Intelligence & Analytics: Comfortable analyzing business 
processes and identifying where AI fits. Worked alongside BI specialists to 
interpret data and quantify benefits (e.g. calculating potential time savings in 
hospital bed management). This cross-functional skillset helped translate 
technical solutions into business outcomes (reduced waiting times, 
automated workflows, etc.).
*	Domains & Industry Knowledge: Developed domain expertise in 
healthcare IT (hospital workflows, electronic health record systems, RPA in 
healthcare) through the LGI project. Additionally gained exposure to 
hospitality domain needs via initial research for Germain Hotels. I also 
stayed updated on AI trends in other industries (finance, retail) via self-study, 
to be ready for future Videns mandates.
*	Communication & Training: Created clear technical documentation and 
executive-friendly presentations. Delivered training sessions explaining 
complex AI concepts in layman’s terms. Bilingual communication 
(French/English) was essential in client interactions and deliverables[13]. I 
regularly wrote emails and reports summarizing analyses for diverse 
audiences – from hands-on client teams to Novacap executives – honing my 
ability to articulate AI value propositions.
*	Collaboration & Project Management: Used Atlassian Confluence and 
Jira/Teams for agile project coordination. Participated in daily scrums, 
sprint plannings, and stakeholder workshops. Coordinated feedback loops 
with clients (for example, collecting client input on training slides[21] or 
clarifying requirements via email[22]). This ensured solutions were built 
iteratively and met real needs. I also navigated the integration of Videns into 
Cofomo’s organization, adapting to new IT environments (e.g. migrating 
email accounts[19]) while maintaining productivity.
Conclusion and Ongoing Development
In summary, my first 3–4 months as an Expert in AI at Videns have been rich and 
impactful. I have led AI strategy consulting for a major healthcare software firm, 
delivering tangible roadmaps and use case analyses that set the foundation for AI 
implementation[2][3]. I have designed and facilitated AI training programs to 
elevate client capabilities[12], and employed Videns’ own tools like Lucia to ground 
our strategies in data[14]. On the technical front, I have driven innovative R&D on 
LLM safety, prototyped solutions to emerging AI security threats[16], and shared 
these learnings internally.
Equipped with a diverse toolkit of technical skills, industry domain knowledge, and 
a strong consulting acumen, I have been able to deliver value across multiple fronts 
– from detailed technical architecture to high-level strategic planning. I speak the 
language of data scientists and software developers, but also that of business 
executives and end-users, enabling me to act as an effective translator between 
technology and business.
Moving forward, I will continue to build on these successes. In the immediate term, 
I will be expanding our AI consulting into the hospitality sector and further refining 
the solutions identified for LGI as they move into implementation phases. I remain 
committed to continuous learning (e.g. exploring advanced NLP techniques and 
domain-specific AI applications) and to mentoring colleagues in AI best practices. 
Overall, these initial months have not only showcased my expertise in AI – 
spanning machine learning, generative AI, and data strategy – but also reinforced 
my passion for applying cutting-edge technology to solve real-world problems, in 
alignment with Videns’ mission of leveraging AI for impactful business 
transformation.
