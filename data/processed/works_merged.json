Mobile health is an emerging field that could significantly reduce health inequities by providing more accessible services. Many mobile apps incorporate gamification elements such as feedback, points, and stories to increase engagement and motivation; however, little is known about how gamification has been incorporated in mobile apps for children with disabilities.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This scoping review aims to identify and synthesize the existing research evidence on the use of gamification in mobile apps for children with disabilities. Specifically, the objectives were to (1) identify the categories of these mobile apps (eg, treatment and educational) (2), describe the health-related outcomes they target, (3) assess the types and levels of gamification elements used within these apps, and (4) determine the reasons for incorporating gamification elements into mobile apps.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We searched MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Embase, the ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore databases to identify papers published between 2008 and 2023.

Findings showed that gamified apps focus on communication skills and oral health in children with autism spectrum disorder while also addressing self-management and academic skills for other disability groups. Gamified mobile apps have demonstrated potential benefits across different populations and conditions; however, there were mixed results regarding their impact. The gamification strategies included fun and playfulness (23/32, 72%), feedback on performance (17/32, 53%), and reinforcement (17/32, 53%) in more than half of apps, whereas social connectivity was used as a gamification strategy in only 4 (12%) mobile apps. There were 2 main reasons for integrating gamification elements into mobile apps described in 16 (42%) studies: increasing user engagement and motivation and enhancing intervention effects.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This scoping review offers researchers a comprehensive review of the gamification elements currently used in mobile apps for the purposes of treatment, education, symptom management, and assessment for children with disabilities. In addition, it indicates that studies on certain disability groups and examinations of health-related outcomes have been neglected, highlighting the need for further investigations in these areas. Furthermore, research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of mobile-based gamification elements on health and health behavior outcomes, as well as the healthy development of children with disabilities.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Information technology (IT) governance has received a lot of attention lately, with a growing strategic importance currently being given to IT by both public and private organizations. This justifies the existence of a body of scientific literature on IT governance, to which this paper belongs and makes an attempt to contribute to.  Towards that end, an empirical study was performed involving 57 public organizations of the Brazilian federal administration, examining the relationship between three governance mechanisms – IT steering committee, IT solution manager, and IT investment portfolio management process  and IT governance effectiveness. Based on the literature review, a conceptual model was developed to express the causal relations that these constructs were expected to hold with one another. Through a custom-designed questionnaire submitted to over 180 federal public employees, the causal model was tested using mediation analysis and mostly confirmed. Results indicate that Portfolio Management should always be taken into account for analyses that aim to evaluate the effects of IT steering committees and solution managers on IT governance effectiveness. This means that a nonexistent or an underperforming Portfolio Management Process can lead to a reduction or cancellation of the potential positive contributions of the other two mechanisms to IT governance. By informing decision makers and public managers at some of the main federal public organizations in the country on how to plan and deploy IT to promote a more effective governance, the conclusions presented herein fill a previous knowledge gap in the complementarity and the joint effectiveness of three IT governance mechanisms on the IT dynamics of key public organizations.</jats:p>",

This exploratory study is undertaken in two preliminary phases. These phases are part of a wider research project to develop a theory about how to continuously improve courses of similar structure and content. The first phase consists of diagnosing improvement actions from the 2010 edition of the course through a qualitative analysis of data obtained using various methods: (1) students’ responses to a questionnaire with open questions; and (2) students’ opinions expressed in a final agile retrospective with all members of the course. The second phase consists of an early application of the identified improvements in the 2011 edition of the course to gather lessons learned, and develop a definite case study design to be used continuously in the next courses offered. Amongst the results, we found that the use of initiatives to promote interactions between groups like Coding Dojo and Brainwritting helps students to effectively learn and share knowledge and experiences, a problem still unsolved when thinking of scaling agile methods. Also, this paper allows keeping track on what is occurring in the course.&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n&#x0D;\n</jats:p>",

Dessa forma, identificou-se a relevância em analisar os fatores que influenciam no desempenho das startups através de variáveis ambientais e organizacionais e suas relações entre si e com o desempenho desses negócios inovadores. Desenvolveu-se assim um modelo teórico com base nas duas principais correntes téoricas da literatura de estratégia empresarial, isto é, considerando os fatores internos à organização e externos de seu ambiente. O método utilizado foi o levantamento (survey), enviado para mais de 700 startups em todo o Brasil, obtendo uma amostra válida de 92 respondentes. A análise dos dados foi baseada na modelagem de equações estruturais, realizada por meio do software SmartPLS. Os resultados indicaram ausência de significância estatística nas hipóteses analisadas, indicando que não há relação entre as variáveis ambientais e organizacionais e o desempenho das startups, potencialmente contribuindo para as teorias utilizadas e que, normalmente, foram desenvolvidas através da análise de grandes empreendimentos.

Starting with the assumptions presented on the seminal work of Everett M. Rogers’ Diffusion of Innovations, a framework to the analysis of the consequences of innovation adoption has been developed and then applied to the case of the open government data adoption by the Federal District Government of Brazil. The model is useful because it shows that different stakeholders of an innovation can perceive inversely the effects of the very same consequence, which brings new perspectives in the management of the innovation process inside a pro-innovation bias society. With the model, it is possible to analyze that some groups put pressure against innovation adoption, not because of resistance to change but because they are perceiving negative consequences related to the innovation adoption. The study presents two major contributions. First theoretical, presenting a model for analysis of the consequences of innovation adoption based on literature review and interview of specialists. Second empirical, providing a way to map the innovation adoption process regarding the view of the different stakeholders’ roles and can be used by the private and public sector.</jats:p>",

Children with disabilities face several restrictions when participating in leisure activities as compared to same age peers without disabilities. Access to information about accessible, inclusive leisure activities is one of the barriers limiting participation, and one potential health promotion strategy is to provide access to information to increase participation. The Jooay App is a mobile app listing such activities in Canada and Australia. With the COVID-19 global pandemic and subsequent public health measures, most community-based facilities providing the activities listed on Jooay were closed. The app therefore started listing online activities offered with the expectation of continuing to provide information for families and understanding the extent to which users relied on the mobile app as a tool to identify new safe leisure opportunities.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Objective</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>This study aims to describe the engagement of the Jooay app before and during COVID-19, and to estimate the extent to which the listing of online activities was related to the engagement of the Jooay app.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Methods</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>We conducted a retrospective study comparing Jooay app use between March 2020 and February 2021 to the engagement between March 2019 and February 2020 by Jooay users.

The addition of online adapted leisure activities to the app’s listings during the pandemic increased app use. Access to information about inclusive activities is a barrier for children with disabilities to engage in leisure. Mobile health solutions can be responsive to contextual factors and consider the social determinants of health such as socioeconomic and public health emergency issues that can impact the participation of vulnerable populations such as children with disabilities and help eliminate barriers to participation. The provision of online leisure opportunities during the pandemic could facilitate participation in these activities during the pandemic and beyond, which is essential and beneficial for the physical and mental well-being of children with disabilities and their families.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>",

The classroom task is to prepare a crowdfunding campaign for their university in a freely available digital platform, having identified a relevant problem on campus. The problem identification is based on market research, where problems disrupting the school are found. To implement student's developed “solutions”, crowdsourcing campaigns are created to expose ideas to market validation, and nudge students to communicate with customers and suppliers. The ‘successful' perceptions of participants signal a large potential for this ‘exercise', as campaigns can be successful, leading to the creation of micro-organizations to run these projects and impact communities positively. Of course, future research should establish correlation between crowdsourcing campaigns and likelihood of starting businesses and social ventures.</p>",

A rede, estruturada sob o mecanismo de conexão preferencial, induz o novo blogueiro ao gerenciamento não só dos recursos dos quais seu blog depende para sobreviver e adquirir atratividadeem um ambiente competitivo, heterogêneo e mutável, mas também ao desafio de superar as incertezas, contingências e vulnerabilidades do contexto em que está inserido. Entretanto, blogueiros agem gerencialmente de forma distinta na busca da sobrevivência e do sucesso?Com essa pergunta em mente, foi desenvolvido um modelo teórico para caracterizar a ação gerencial do blogueiro de acordo com o contexto do blog. O teste empírico, realizado com 21 blogs por meio de combinação de pesquisa qualitativae quantitativa, indicou não só que blogueiros adotam estilos de gestão adaptativos, mas que suas ações evoluem na busca dessa atratividade, sinalizando que o gerenciamento pode ser uma forma de superar o favoritismo presente na rede. Os resultados contribuem para o entendimento de como certos blogs alcançam o sucesso de forma rápida e legítima ao atuarem contextualizadamente e com dinamismo, explicandoassim a ocorrência de troca de liderança, antes considerada aleatória na perspectiva da teoria de redes (conexão preferencial).</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>ABSTRACT It is common for community-based free software projects to be associated with an organizational scenario that resembles “a bazaar more than a cathedral,” and to differ from the traditional, or ‘bureaucratic’ way of organizing work. This paper analyzes the governance of these organizations from the perspective of their structure and control, considering the development trajectory of three community-based free software projects in Brazil. Results show that the constant need to produce modern technologies gives rise to external pressures that promote change - albeit temporary - in the governance of these projects, making them resemble a cathedral more than a bazaar. Governance does not follow a cycle of sequential improvement; it changes depending on the external organizational actors present, such as sponsors. This suggests the need for strategic and flexible governance to deal with the acquisition and allocation of organizational resources. Governance of the projects described here varies along a spectrum of (in)formality that allows both production models - cathedral or bazaar - to exist in the same organization at different periods.</jats:p>",

Nesse sentido, partindo do pressuposto de que popularidade é um construto e que as redes das quais os blogs fazem parte são moldadas por conexão preferencial, de modo que os blogs populares tendem a se tornar cada vez mais populares, desenvolvemos um modelo teórico para o entendimento da composição da popularidade em blogs, suas causas e consequências. Nós testamos empiricamente esse modelo e encontramos suporte para nossas suposições teóricas. Dentre os principais resultados, encontramos que o construto sugerido é confiável, que a idade do blog influencia a popularidade, e que esta é uma importante preditora da quantidade de autores de um blog.</jats:p>",

Na sequência, realizou-se entrevistas com oito professores universitários de estratégia.Contribuições teóricas/práticas/sociais: Os entrevistados conheciam os jogos sérios e destacaram a habilidade deles em integrar áreas de ensino, engajar e desenvolver o trabalho em equipe e capacidades analíticas. Apesar disso, o uso dos jogos pelos docentes ocorreu informalmente e sem relação direta com os tópicos de estratégia. Conclui-se que apesar do reconhecimento do potencial prático e lúdico dos jogos, o seu uso é pouco realizado nas universidades, ocorrendo de maneira complementar, não estruturada, ou sem integração com as ementas de estratégia.Originalidade/relevância: A temática é relevante por trazer um melhor entendimento sobre os jogos sérios e sua aplicação no ensino de graduação das universidades brasileiras.</jats:p>",

After that - in a society increasingly digital and connected - the DIKW pyramid became popular, featuring variants containing only data, information and knowledge, in a short DIK configuration, or adding levels like intelligence; at the same time that very little critical interpretation and empirical validation were performed by researchers to clarify how these elements are indeed intertwined. This left theoretical implications of the original model unnoticed, not empirically validated, becoming a taken-for-granted explanation that do not fully grasp the chain of knowledge creation, a process that has been carefully studied by researchers. This study reviews and systematically analyzes relevant papers, covering the period of 32 years of research, to pinpoint the main weaknesses of the DIKW model and propose a new one in conformance with the knowledge management literature, and considering the current scenario of artificial intelligence and ethical dilemmas. The resulting model challenges the pyramid as the best way to convey this 'causal process' of knowledge creation to the public, and makes the necessity of empirical studies to be performed in the future clear.\n                </jats:p>",

In the web server market, Apache has dominated in terms of market share for over 15 years, outperforming corporations and research institutions. The resource-based view (RBV) of firms posits that an organization outperforms its competitors because it has valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitutable resources. Accordingly, one concludes that Apache possesses such resources to sustain its competitive advantage. However, one does not know what those resources are. This chapter is an effort to locate them, answering the question: “What resources enable Apache to outperform its for-profit competitors consistently?” This research draws on the RBV to develop a series of propositions about Apache’s internal resources and organizational capabilities. For each proposition developed, methods for their empirical validation are proposed, and future research directions are provided.</jats:p>",

Children with disabilities face several restrictions when participating in leisure activities as compared to same age peers without disabilities. Access to information about accessible, inclusive leisure activities is one of the barriers limiting participation, and one potential health promotion strategy is to provide access to information to increase participation. The Jooay App is a mobile app listing such activities in Canada and Australia. With the COVID-19 global pandemic and subsequent public health measures, most community-based facilities providing the activities listed on Jooay were closed. The app therefore started listing online activities offered with the expectation of continuing to provide information for families and understanding the extent to which users relied on the mobile app as a tool to identify new safe leisure opportunities.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>OBJECTIVE</title>\n                        <p>This study aims to describe the engagement of the Jooay app before and during COVID-19, and to estimate the extent to which the listing of online activities was related to the engagement of the Jooay app.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>METHODS</title>\n                        <p>We conducted a retrospective study comparing Jooay app use between March 2020 and February 2021 to the engagement between March 2019 and February 2020 by Jooay users. Spearman rank correlations were carried out to identify associations between the activities listed and the users’ engagement from May 2020 to February 2021.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>RESULTS</title>\n                        <p>Active engagement with the Jooay app from March 2020 to February 2021 dropped by an average of 135 engagements (64.2%) compared to engagements in 2019-2020. The largest monthly drop in engagement was observed in May 2020 by 239 engagements (88.8%). There was a strong positive correlation between the number of active users and the number of online activities listed on the app (r&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;=0.900).</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>The engagement with the Jooay App presented an expected decrease during the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic. The addition of online adapted leisure activities to the app’s listings during the pandemic increased app use. Access to information about inclusive activities is a barrier for children with disabilities to engage in leisure. Mobile health solutions can be responsive to contextual factors and consider the social determinants of health such as socioeconomic and public health emergency issues that can impact the participation of vulnerable populations such as children with disabilities and help eliminate barriers to participation. The provision of online leisure opportunities during the pandemic could facilitate participation in these activities during the pandemic and beyond, which is essential and beneficial for the physical and mental well-being of children with disabilities and their families.</p>\n                </sec>",

Mobile health is an emerging field that could significantly reduce health inequities by providing more accessible services.

Gamified mobile apps have demonstrated potential benefits across different populations and conditions; however, there were mixed results regarding their impact. The gamification strategies included fun and playfulness (23/32, 72%), feedback on performance (17/32, 53%), and reinforcement (17/32, 53%) in more than half of apps, whereas social connectivity was used as a gamification strategy in only 4 (12%) mobile apps. There were 2 main reasons for integrating gamification elements into mobile apps described in 16 (42%) studies: increasing user engagement and motivation and enhancing intervention effects.</p>\n                </sec>\n                                <sec>\n                    <title>CONCLUSIONS</title>\n                        <p>This scoping review offers researchers a comprehensive review of the gamification elements currently used in mobile apps for the purposes of treatment, education, symptom management, and assessment for children with disabilities. In addition, it indicates that studies on certain disability groups and examinations of health-related outcomes have been neglected, highlighting the need for further investigations in these areas. Furthermore, research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of mobile-based gamification elements on health and health behavior outcomes, as well as the healthy development of children with disabilities.</p>\n                </sec>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>A vulnerabilidade inicial representa as dificuldades que as empresas nascentes sofrem devido a fatores internos e externos. Nesse sentido, Incubadoras de Empresas representam políticas públicas que apoiam os empreendimentos nascentes mitigando os impactos da vulnerabilidade inicial. Entretanto, após a incubação, algumas empresas não conseguem sobreviver aos desafios de um mercado dinâmico e altamente competitivo, configurando um contexto especial para se estudar a vulnerabilidade “inicial”. Aspectos contingenciais como satisfação com a incubadora, tamanho e inovação tecnológica são importantes fatores para a sobrevivência desses empreendimentos que contaram com o apoio de incubadoras. Dentre os fatores que contribuem para superar a vulnerabilidade inicial, a literatura identifica a legitimidade, os recursos e as capacidades dinâmicas. O objetivo deste artigo é identificar as técnicas de aprendizagem de manuseio de máquinas robustas para prever a sobrevivência de empresas graduadas a partir de seus aspectos contingenciais e da legitimidade, capacidades dinâmicas e recursos. Empregou-se a estratégia de estudo de casos múltiplos, com 90 empresas graduadas de 15 incubadoras da região sudeste e centro-oeste. Na análise de dados, empregou-se os algoritmos de aprendizagem de máquina que foram implementados em Python. Os resultados mostraram aptidão para encontrar soluções com altos indicadores de acurácia, com destaque para os métodos Gaussian NB e Support Vector Machine. Esta pesquisa apresenta contribuições teóricas ao reforçar o papel da legitimidade para a sobrevivência de novos empreendimentos. Além do mais, o fato de ser uma empresa de base tecnológica, se caracteriza como um fator importante para a sobrevivência, o que reflete em uma contribuição gerencial.\nPalavras-chaves: Vulnerabilidade inicial; Pós-incubação; Sobrevivência organizacional; Aprendizagem de máquina.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "<jats:p>Objetivo: Identificar e explorar os elementos colaborativos em dados abertos governamentais, com foco nas plataformas de dados abertos.\nMetodologia/abordagem: Foi realizada uma pesquisa exploratória, qualitativa e bibliográfica nas bases de dados Scopus, SienceDirect, Web of Science, Scielo, ACM, Proquest e IEEE com o intuito de identificar estudos que contemplem o desenvolvimento dos dados abertos governamentais por meio da colaboração. Além disso, também foi executada uma análise de benchmarking em 32 plataformas interativas para identificar as melhores práticas e funcionalidades em termos de colaboração.\nOriginalidade/relevância: Os dados abertos governamentais podem ser considerados uma inovação importante e influente que tem o potencial de impulsionar a criação de valor público. Embora muitos países mantenham portais abertos de dados governamentais, os elementos colaborativos dos portais são limitados.\nPrincipais resultados: Os resultados revelaram 25 elementos colaborativos que podem expandir o potencial colaborativo do ambiente dos dados abertos governamentais. Esses elementos demonstraram contribuir, de maneira substancial, para uma abordagem mais colaborativa e eficiente, proporcionando o acesso universal e fortalecendo a utilização de dados abertos para diversas finalidades, alinhado à promoção de transparência e responsabilidade em múltiplos setores. \nContribuições teóricas: A pesquisa contribui ao destacar a necessidade de aprofundar o estudo sobre colaboração em dados abertos, propondo novas abordagens para desenvolver ecossistemas mais integrativos e colaborativos.\nContribuições para a gestão: Esse trabalho destaca a importância de buscar a colaboração em plataformas de dados abertos governamentais, contribuindo para o alcance de uma maior transparência, eficácia e inovação no uso de dados.</jats:p>",
